K.P.I's for a proposed club called the Multinational Student Society (M.S.S.) that can help quantify, track and eventually solve the glaring volunteer hour deficit at this uni. 

Code absolutely will not run in a Julia REPL rn so don't even try it...does work in jupyter notebook though. 

I'll revisit it sometime to retrofit the variable n function definitions into a main() function so it can run in a REPL by itself. 

Definition of the KPI's can be found in the proposal...will add here later.
